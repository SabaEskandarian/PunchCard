Punch card scheme with curve25519-dalek

Performance Results (computer)
Each operation is repeated for 1000 iterations, except punches, which are done 10000 times (10 punches per iteration). 
The server database starts with 0 used punchcards in each iteration. 
Numbers are cumulative over all runs, in microseconds.
Server setup: 18590
Client setup: 65722
Server punch: 1343669
Client punch: 3123742
Client redeem: 65837
Server redeem: 64278

so the averages are (in microseconds):
Server setup: 18.590
Client setup: 65.722
Server punch: 134.3669
Client punch: 312.3742
Client redeem: 65.837
Server redeem: 64.278

When I increased the starting database size to 1M, I got these numbers
Server setup: 27371
Client setup: 85662
Server punch: 1562951
Client punch: 3497363
Client redeem: 73585
Server redeem: 72136
The only one whose performance should be affected by the database size is server redeem, but it does not look different relative to the other numbers (the results are generally high variance). This is not surprising because the only DB-dependent operation is the hash table lookup.

Communication costs (for messages sent in protocol)
Server setup: 32 bytes (g^secret)
Client setup: none
Client punch: 32 bytes (the punchcard group element)
Server punch: 128 bytes (new group element and proof which has 2 group elements and a scalar, 32 bytes each)
Client redeem: 64 bytes (the final card and the secret used to make the card, 32 bytes each)
Server redeem: none


Time for lookup in hashset of 1 million entries is <1 microsecond (about .2-.3 microseconds)
Time for exponentiation is about 50 microseconds (usually between 50 and 55)
so to do 1M exponentiations (one for each previously used card) would probably be about 50 seconds. The speedup is about 8 orders of magnitude.
